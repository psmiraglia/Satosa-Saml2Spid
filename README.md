# Satosa-Saml2Spid

This is a SAML2/OIDC configuration for [SATOSA](https://github.com/IdentityPython/SATOSA)
that aims to setup a **SAML-to-SAML Proxy** and **OIDC-to-SAML** compatible with the  **SPID - the Italian Digital Identity System**.

## General features

- SPID SP
- eIDAS FICEP SP (see [ficep support PR here](https://github.com/italia/Satosa-Saml2Spid/pull/47))
- SAML2 IDP
- OIDC OP (see [satosa-oidcop](https://github.com/UniversitaDellaCalabria/SATOSA-oidcop))

## Goal

Satosa-Saml2 Spid is an intermediary between many SAML2/OIDC Service Providers (RP) and many SAML2 Identity Providers.
Specifically it allows traditional Saml2 Service Providers to communicate with
**Spid Identity Providers** adapting Metadata and AuthnRequest operations to the Spid technical requirements.

![big picture](gallery/spid_proxy.png)

**Figure1** : _Common scenario, a traditional SAML2 Service Provider (SP) that's proxied through the SATOSA SPID Backend gets compliances on AuthnRequest and Metadata operations_.

More generally this solution allows us to adopt multiple proxy _frontends_ and _backends_
to adapt and allows to communicate systems that, due to protocol or specific
limitations, traditionally could not interact each other.

**Short glossary**

- **Frontend**, interface of the proxy that is configured as a SAML2 Identity Provider
- **Backend**, interface of the proxy that is configured as a SAML2 Service Provider
- **TargetRouting**, a SATOSA microservice for selecting the output backend to reach the endpoint (IdP) selected by the user
- **Discovery Service**, interface that allows users to select the authentication endpoint


## Demo components

The example project comes with the following demo pages, served
with the help of an additional webserver dedicated for static contents:


###### Discovery Service page
![disco](gallery/disco.png)


###### Generic error page
![err_gen](gallery/error_page.png)


###### Saml2 Signature Error page
![err1](gallery/error1.png)


###### AgID SPID test #104
![err2](gallery/error2.png)


You can find these demo pages in `example/static` and edit at your taste.
To get redirection to these pages, or redirection to third-party services, consider the following configuration files:

- `example/proxy_conf.yml`, example: `UNKNOW_ERROR_REDIRECT_PAGE: "https://localhost:9999/error_page.html"`
- `example/plugins/{backends,frontends}/$filename`, example: `disco_srv: "https://localhost:9999/static/disco.html"`

Remember to edit and customize all the values like `"CHANGE_ME!"` in the configuration files, in `proxy_conf.yaml` and in plugins configurations.

## Docker compose
````
pip install docker-compose
````

Create your project folder, starting from our example project
````
cp -R example project
# do your customizations in project/
````

Create volumes
````
docker volume create --name=satosa-saml2saml_certs
docker volume create --name=satosa-saml2saml_conf
docker volume create --name=satosa-saml2saml_statics
docker volume create --name=satosa-saml2saml_logs
````

Where the data are
`docker volume ls`

Copy files in destination volumes
````
cp project/pki/*pem `docker volume inspect -f '{{.Mountpoint}}' satosa-saml2saml_certs`
cp -R project/* `docker volume inspect -f '{{.Mountpoint}}' satosa-saml2saml_conf`
cp -R project/static/* `docker volume inspect -f '{{.Mountpoint}}' satosa-saml2saml_statics`
````

Run the stack
````
docker-compose up
````

See [mongo readme](./mongo) to have some example of demo data.

## OIDC

this project uses [SATOSA_oidcop](https://github.com/UniversitaDellaCalabria/SATOSA-oidcop) as OAuth2/OIDC frontend module.
Comment/uncomment the following statement in the proxy_configuration to enable it.

https://github.com/italia/Satosa-Saml2Spid/blob/oidcop/example/proxy_conf.yaml#L32


## Setup

###### Prepare environment
````
mkdir satosa_proxy && cd satosa_proxy
virtualenv -ppython3 satosa.env
source satosa.env/bin/activate
````

###### Dependencies Ubuntu
````
sudo apt install -y libffi-dev libssl-dev python3-pip xmlsec1 procps libpcre3 libpcre3-dev

git clone https://github.com/italia/Satosa-Saml2Spid.git repository
pip install -r repository/requirements.txt
````

###### Dependencies Centos/RHEL
````
sudo yum install -y libffi-devel openssl-devel python3-pip xmlsec1 procps pcre pcre-devel
pip install --upgrade pip
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
sudo yum install -y python3-wheel python3-devel


git clone https://github.com/italia/Satosa-Saml2Spid.git repository
pip install -r repository/requirements.txt
````

## Configure the Proxy

- Create certificates for SPID see [psmiraglia](https://github.com/italia/spid-compliant-certificates).
- Copy `repository/example/*` contents (`cp -R repository/example/* .`) and **edit the following files** with your preferred configuration.

These are the configuration files:

- `proxy_conf.yaml`
- `plugins/backends/spidsaml2_backend.yaml`
- `plugins/backends/saml2_backend.yaml`
- `plugins/frontend/saml2_frontend.yaml`
- `plugins/frontend/oidc_op_frontend.yaml` (optional to enable OIDC Provider)


## Saml2 Metadata

If you want to handle metadata file manually, as this example purpose as demostration,
create `metadata/idp` and `metadata/sp` folders, then copy metadata:

````
mkdir -p metadata/idp metadata/sp
wget https://localhost:8080/metadata.xml -O metadata/idp/spid-saml-check.xml
wget https://registry.spid.gov.it/metadata/idp/spid-entities-idps.xml -O metadata/idp/spid-entities-idps.xml
````

Copy your SP metadata to your Proxy
````
wget https://sp.fqdn.org/saml2/metadata -O metadata/sp/my-sp.xml
````

Otherwise the best method would be enabling a MDQ server in each frontend and backend configuration file.
See `example/plugins/{backends,frontends}/$filename` as example.


## Start the Proxy

**Warning**: these examples must be intended only for test purpose, for a demo run. Please remember that the following examples wouldn't be intended for a real production environment! If you need some example for a production environment please take a look at `example/uwsgi_setup/` folder.

````
export SATOSA_APP=$VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/$(python -c 'import sys; print(f"python{sys.version_info.major}.{sys.version_info.minor}")')/site-packages/satosa

# only https with satosa, because its Cookie only if "secure" would be sent
uwsgi --wsgi-file $SATOSA_APP/wsgi.py  --https 0.0.0.0:10000,./pki/cert.pem,./pki/privkey.pem --callable app -b 32768

# additional static serve for the demo Discovery Service with Spid button
uwsgi --https 0.0.0.0:9999,./pki/cert.pem,./pki/privkey.pem --check-static-docroot --check-static ./static/ --static-index disco.html
````

### Get SPID backend metadata

The proxy backend exposes its SPID metadata at the following url (customizable):
````
https://localhost:10000/spidSaml2/metadata
````


#### Get Proxy Metadata for your SP

The Proxy metadata must be configured in your SP. Your SP is an entity that's external from this Proxy, eg: shibboleth sp, djangosaml2, another ...
````
wget https://localhost:10000/Saml2IDP/metadata -O path/to/your/sp/metadata/satosa-spid.xml --no-check-certificate
````

Then start an authentication from your SP.

![result](gallery/screen.gif)
**Figure 2**: The result using spid-saml-check.

## Hints

If you're doing tests and you don't want to pass by Discovery page each time you can use idphinting but only if your SP support it!
Here an example using djangosaml2 as SP:

```
http://localhost:8000/saml2/login/?idp=https://localhost:10000/Saml2IDP/metadata&next=/saml2/echo_attributes&idphint=https%253A%252F%252Flocalhost%253A8080
```

IF you're going to test Satosa-Saml2Spid with spid-sp-test, take a look to
its CI, [here](.github/workflows/python-app.yml),

## Additional technical informations for Developers

#### SPID technical Requirements

The SaToSa **SPID** backend contained in this project adopt specialized forks of pySAML2 and SATOSA, that implements the following patches,
read [this](README.idpy.forks.mngmnt.md) for any further explaination about how to patch by hands.

All the patches and features are currently merged and available with the following releases:
- [pysaml2](https://github.com/peppelinux/pysaml2/tree/pplnx-v7.0.1-1)
- [SATOSA](https://github.com/peppelinux/SATOSA/tree/oidcop-v8.0.0)


#### Pending contributions to idpy

These are mandatory only for getting Spid SAML2 working, these are not needed for any other traditional SAML2 deployment:

- [date_xsd_type](https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2/pull/602/files)
- [disabled_weak_algs](https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2/pull/628)
- [ns_prefixes](https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2/pull/625)
- [SATOSA unknow error handling](https://github.com/IdentityPython/SATOSA/pull/324)
- [SATOSA redirect page on error](https://github.com/IdentityPython/SATOSA/pull/325)


#### Warnings
Here something that you should know before start.

- You must enable more than a single IdP (multiple metadata or single metadata with multiple entities) to get *Discovery Service* working.
- Proxy doesn't handle SAML2 SLO, so the spidSaml2 backend is configured with Authnforce -> True. For any further information see [Single Logout in Satosa](https://github.com/IdentityPython/SATOSA/issues/211).
- SATOSA Saml2 backend configuration have a **policy** section that will let us to define specialized behaviours
  and configuration for each SP (each by entityid). In this example I defined a single "default" behaviour with attributes **name_format**
  to **urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri**, due to my needs to handle many service providers for which it could be painfull do a static definition each time.
  An additional "hack" have been made in `example/attributes-maps/satosa_spid_uri_hybrid.py`, where I adopted a hybrid mapping that works for
  both *URI* and *BASIC* formats. Feel free to customized or decouple these format in different files and per SP.
